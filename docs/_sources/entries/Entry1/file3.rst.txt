Earning Estimation Assumptions
****************************************

The data presented doesn't actually provide the exact details of transactions between visitor and rental owner.

Therefore, earnings are calculated conservatively derived from the assumptions in the 'Occupancy model' stated in the  disclaimers of the `data site <http://insideairbnb.com/about.html>`_.

Thus following formula was used to estimate the earning per listing: 


.. code-block:: html

    Earnings =  number of reviews 
                    x
                minimum number of nights (stated by listing)  
                    x
                price /Night (stated by listing).

Also these earnings are pre-tax & gross revenue. Any tax impact or operational cost deduction was not considered to calculate the final/net earnings.
