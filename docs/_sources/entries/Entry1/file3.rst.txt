Earning Estimation and Assumptions
****************************************

The data presented doesn't actually provide the exact details of transactions between visitor and rental owner.

Therefore, earnings are calculated conservatively based on the assumptions stated on the 'Occupancy model' stated in the  disclaimers of the `data providing site <http://insideairbnb.com/about.html>`_.

Thus following formula was used to estimate the earning per listing:

    Earnings =  number of reviews 
                    x
                minimum number of nights (stated by listing)  
                    x
                price /Night (stated by listing).
