Hypothesis testing in Statistics: 
***********************************

Common hypothesis tests include:

    * Testing a population mean `One sample t-test <http://sites.utexas.edu/sos/guided/inferential/numeric/claim/one-sample-t/>`_.
    * Testing the difference in means `Two sample t-test <https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/hypothesis-testing/making-sense-two-sample-t-test/>`_
    * Testing the difference before and after some treatment on the same individual `Paired t-test <https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/hypothesis-testing/making-sense-two-sample-t-test/>`_ 
    * Testing a population proportion `One sample z-test <http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=one-sample%20z-test>`_
    * Testing the difference between population proportions `Two sample z-test <https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/268>`_

You can use one of these sites to provide a t-table or z-table to support one of the above approaches:

    * `t-table or z-table <http://www.z-table.com/t-value-table.html>`_
